To associate your Fitbit.com account with the SEP tracking system, please follow these instructions:
1) Go to {url here}
2) If asked, log in to your Fitbit.com account
3) Press the "allow" button when prompted
4) Copy the PIN provided by Fitbit.com into an email reply to this message

Thank you.

By registering with the automated reporting tool, you grant the script read-only access to your data at the Fitbit website. We'll run a script every Monday that automatically collects and aggregates your steps for each day in the previous calendar week. Laura will get an email that details your weekly step activity and your team's weekly totals. This eases your (and your team's) reporting burden and ensures that Laura gets consistently formatted data for tracking progress toward individual and team prizes.

If you have any questions, please contact Todd, Jon, or Laura.
